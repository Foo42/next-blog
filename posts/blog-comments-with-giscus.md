title: Blog Comments via Giscus
---

I've decided to add comments to this blog using [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which uses github discussions (in [this repository](https://github.com/Foo42/julianhaeger-dot-com-comments/discussions)) to store comments.

I have a longer-term aspiration to build [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) endpoints into the site such that it can participate directly in the Fediverse, with responses displayed at the bottom of posts in place of comments, but this is likely to take some time (if I ever get to doing it) and I don't want to let the "perfect be the enemy of the good" and have no commenting solution until then.
