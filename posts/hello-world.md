I’m another software developer who felt like starting a blog. Unlike most though, I’m not going to begin with a promise to myself (let’s face it, who else reads a first post!) about how I’m going to “be really good and keep updating every day not like the last 100 blogs I started”. I’m not. That’s not the point. I just want somewhere to put the occasional musings, primarily on software and tech, which don’t fit into 140 characters, and hence I never publish.
